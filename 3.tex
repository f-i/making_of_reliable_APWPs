``Age Position Picking (APP)'' method is better than the ``Age Mean Picking
(AMP)'' method for making a reliable paleomagnetic APWP and weighting is
actually unnecessary.

\section{Introduction}

APWPs are generated by combining paleomagnetic poles, also known as paleopoles,
for a particular rigid block over the desired age range to produce a smoothed
path. See the Appendix A for some examples how the paleopole datasets are
constrained for a particular tectonic plate during a specific time interval.

\subsection{Not All Data Are Created Equal}

However, uncertainties in the age and location of paleopoles can vary greatly
for different poles.

\subsubsection{Age Error}

Although remanent magnetizations are generally assumed to be primary, many
events can cause remagnetisation (in which case the derived pole is `younger'
than the rock). If an event that has occurred since the rock's formation that
should affect the magnetisation (e.g., folding, thermal overprinting due to
intrusion) can be shown to have affected it, then it constrains the
magnetisation to have been acquired before that event. Recognising or ruling
out remagnetisations depends on these field tests, which are not always
performed or possible. Even a passed field test may not be useful if field test
shows magnetisation acquired prior to a folding event tens of millions of years
after initial rock formation.

The most obvious characteristic we can observe from paleomagnetic data is that
some poles have very large age ranges, e.g., more than 100 Myr. The
magnetization age should be some time between the information of the rock and
folding events. There are also others where we have similar position but the age
constraint is much narrower, e.g. 10 Myr window or less. Obviously the latter
kind of data is more valuable than the one with large age range.

\subsubsection{Position Error}

The errors of pole latitudes and longitudes are 95\% confidence ellipses, which
also vary greatly in magnitude. All paleopoles have some associated
uncertainties due to measurement error and the nature of the geomagnetic field.
More uncertainties can be added by too few samples, sampling spanning too short
a time range to approximate a GAD field, failure to remove overprints during
demagnetisation, etc.

\subsubsection{Data Consistency}

Paleopoles of a rigid plate or block should be continuous time series. For a
rigid plate, two poles with similar ages shouldn't be dramatically different in
location. Sometimes, this is the case. Sometimes we have further separated poles
with close ages.

There are a number of possible causes for these outliers, including:

\verb"Lithology"

For poor consistency of data, it is potentially because of different
inclinations or declinations. The first thing we should consider about is their
lithology. We want to check if the sample rock are igneous or sedimentary,
because sediment compaction can result in anomalously shallow
inclinations~\cite{T19}. In addition, we also can check if the rock are redbeds
or non-redbeds. Although whether redbeds record a detrital signal or a later
Chemical Remanent Magnetization (CRM) is still somewhat controversial, both
sedimentary rocks and redbeds could lead to inconsistency in direction compared
to igneous rocks.

\verb"Local Rotations"

Local deformation between two paleomagnetic localities invalidates the rigid
plate assumption and could lead to inconsistent VGP directions. So if
discordance is due to local deformation, and we would ideally want to exclude
such poles from our APWP calculation.

\verb"Other Factors"

In most cases, mean pole age (centre of age error) has just been binned. If
any of the poles have large age errors, they could be different ages from each
other and sample entirely different parts of the APWP\@. Conversely, if any of
the poles have too few samples, or were not sampled over enough time to average
to a GAD field, a discordant pole may be due to unreduced secular variation.

\subsubsection{Data Density}

As we go back in time, we have lower quality and lower density (or quantity) of
data, for example, the Precambrian or Early Paleozoic paleomagnetic data are
relatively fewer than Middle-Late Phanerozoic ones, and most of them are not
high-quality, e.g., larger errors in both age and location. The combination of
lower data quality with lower data density means that a single `bad' pole (with
large errors in age and/or location) can much more easily distort the
reconstructed APWP, because there are few or no `good' poles to counteract its
influence.

Data density also varies between different plates. E.g., we have a relatively
high density of paleomagnetic data for North American Craton (NAC), but few
poles exist for Greenland and Arabia. Based on mean age (mean of lower and upper
magnetic ages), for 120\textendash0 Ma, the \textbf{Global Paleomagnetic
Database} (GPMDB) version 4.6b~\cite[updated in 2016 by the Ivar Giaever
Geomagnetic Laboratory team, in collaboration with Pisarevsky]{M96,P05} has more
than 130 poles for NAC, but only 17 for Greenland and 24 for Arabia.

\subsubsection{Publication Year}

The time when the data was published should also be considered, because
magnetism measuring methodology, technology and equipments have been improved
since the early 20th century. For example, stepwise demagnetisation, which is
the most reliable method of detecting and removing secondary overprints, has
only been in common use since the mid 1980s.

In summary, not all paleopoles are created equal, which leads to an important
question: how to best combine poles of varying quality into a coherent and
accurate APWP\@?

\subsection{Existing Solutions and General Issues}

Paleomagnetists have proposed a variety of methods to filter so-called ``bad''
data, or give lower weights to those ``bad'' data before generating an APWP,
e.g., two widely used methods: the V90 reliability criteria~\cite{v90} and the
BC02 selection criteria provided by Besse \& Courtillot \shortcite{B02}.
Briefly, the V90 criteria for paleomagnetic results includes seven criteria: (1)
Well determined age; (2) At least 25 samples with Fisher~\cite{F53} precision
$\kappa$ greater than 10 and $\alpha95$ less than 16\degree; (3) Detailed
demagnetisation results reported; (4) Passed field tests; (5) Tectonic coherence
with continent and good structural control; (6) Identified antipodal reversals;
(7) Lack of similarity with younger poles~\cite{T92}. The total criteria
satisfied (0\textendash7) is then used as a measure of a paleomagnetic result's
overall reliability, which is known as Q (quality) factor~\cite{T92}. Q factor
is indeed a very straightforward way to get a quantitalized reliability score.
Also it then can be conveniently used in the later calculations of
APWPs~\cite{T92}. But at the same time this is a fairly basic filter that lumps
together criteria that may not be equally important. Compared with V90, the BC02
criteria suggests stricter filtering, e.g., using only poles with at least 6
sampling sites and 36 samples, each site having $\alpha95$ less than 10\degree\
in the Cenozoic and 15\degree\ in the Mesozoic. B02 is also straightforward and
convenient to use, but some useful data may be filtered out and wasted
especially for a period where there are only limited number of data. In
addition, there has been limited study of how effective these marking/filtering
methods are at reconstructing a `true' APWP, and for most studies after a basic
filtering of `low quality' poles, the remaining poles are, in fact, treated
equally.

Above all, there haven't been any real attempts to study how APWP fits may be
improved by filtering/weighting data. This paper is presented to address these
issues.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{General Approach}

In this study, we use paleopoles extracted from the GPMDB to generate APWPs for
the period 120\textendash0 Ma. A range of possible APW paths for North America,
India and Australia can be generated from the extracted sets of paleopoles using
various binning, filtering and weighting methods (Tables.~\ref{tab-pick}
and~\ref{tab-weit}). These paths can then be compared to synthetic APWPs
independently generated from an absolute plate motion model. The three plates
chosen have different attributes, both in terms of the input data set and the
nature of the reference APWP.

\subsection{Paleomagnetic Data}

\subsubsection{Used Specific Field Codes of GPMDB}

Data analysis includes a tremendous amount of manipulation of data
fields/columns in the GPMDB\@. In the following content, several specific fields
and field codes will be referred to. They are listed below for easy reference.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Paleomagnetic Data of Three Representative Continents}

Collections of paleopoles with a minimum age (LOMAGAGE) $\leq$135 Ma for the
North American (Plate ID 101), the Indian (ID 501) and Australian (ID 801)
plates, were extracted from the GPMDB\@. In order to include valid paleopoles
from blocks that moved independently prior to 120 Ma, which therefore have
different assigned plate codes in the GPMDB, the spatial join
technique~\cite{J07} was used to find all poles within the geographic region
that defines the rigid plate within the period of interest (see also Appendix
A):

\subparagraph{for North America,}
the search region was defined by the North American (ID 101), Avalon/Acadia (ID
108) and Piedmont (ID 109) blocks, as defined by the recently published plate
model of~\cite{Y18}. Following extraction, 58 poles from southwestern North
America that have been affected by regional rotations since 36 Ma~\cite{Mc06},
were removed. The final dataset consists of 135 paleopoles
(Fig.~\ref{fig-120NAhist}), with 76 (about 56.3\%) sampled from dominantly
igneous sequences; 56 (about 41.5\%) sampled from mostly sedimentary sequences,
including 6 from redbeds); and 3 (about 2.2\%) from metamorphic sequences. The
principal features of the age distribution are a larger number of young ($<$5
Ma) poles, and relatively fewer poles in the Late Cretaceous and Miocene.

\subparagraph{for India,}
the Indian block (ID 501) as defined by~\cite{Y18} was used, but following
extraction 31 paleopoles associated with parts of the northern margin that
have undergone regional rotations since the Jurassic~\cite{G15} were removed.
The final dataset consists of 75 paleopoles (Fig.~\ref{fig-120INhist}), with
39 (52\%) sampled from dominantly igneous sequences and 36 (48\%) sampled from
mostly sedimentary sequences, including 3 from redbeds). There is a high
concentration of poles from the latest Cretaceous\textendash{}Early Cenozoic
(c.70\textendash60 Ma), many of which are igneous; in younger and older
intervals, there are fewer, mostly sedimentary poles.

\subparagraph{for Australia,}
the Australia (ID 801), Sumba (ID 675), and Timor (ID 684) blocks as defined
by~\cite{Y18} were used, in combination with data from the Tasmania block (ID
805) younger than c. 100 Ma (with a maximum age (HIMAGAGE) $\leq$100 Ma), prior
to which it was not fixed with respect to Australia~\cite{Y18}. The final
dataset consists of 99 paleopoles (Fig.~\ref{fig-120AUhist}), with 61 (61.6\%)
sampled from dominantly igneous sequences and 38 (38.4\%) sampled from mostly
sedimentary sequences, including 9 from redbeds). The temporal distribution of
poles is relatively uniform.

Compared with North American (Fig.~\ref{fig-120NAhist}) and Australian
(Fig.~\ref{fig-120AUhist}) paleopoles, Indian paleopoles are in relatively lower
density in general except during the period of about 70\textendash60 Ma
(Fig.~\ref{fig-120INhist}).

\end{figure*}

\subsection{APWP Generation}

Multiple APWPs were generated using the selected poles for each of the three
plates as follows:

\subparagraph{Picking/binning.} A moving average or moving window technique
was used: paleopoles were selected for each APWP time step (initially 5 Myr
step length from 0 to 120 Ma) if their age fell within a window centered on the
current step age. In this study, the width of the moving window was always twice
that of time step (i.e.\ initially 10 Myr), such that each window half-overlaps
with its neighbours.

\subparagraph{Filtering.} Poles with characteristics thought to correspond to
poor data quality, or lacking characteristics thought to correspond to good
data quality, were discarded (or in some cases, corrected).

\subparagraph{Weighting.} Calculation of a weighted Fisher mean~\cite{F53} of
the remaining poles within each window, using weighting functions intended to
increase the influence of higher quality poles relative to lower quality ones.

28 different picking and filtering algorithms were tested
(Table.~\ref{tab-pick}), in combination with 6 different weighting algorithms
(Table.~\ref{tab-weit}), for the three plates. The effects of changing the time
step length and width of the moving window, and the reference path, were also
examined.

\subsubsection{Picking/Binning}

In studies where the moving window method is used to calculate an
APWP~\cite{T99,T08}, a paleopole is generally considered to fall in the
current window only if the mid-point of its age limits fall within that window.
If paleopole has a large age uncertainty compared to the size of the moving
window, it will not be included in the moving windows close to the beginning and
end of the age range, which are arguably more likely magnetisation ages than the
mid-point. To investigate this issue, we compare the performance of moving
windows populated using the mid-point picking criterion, referred to hereafter
as ``Age Mean Picking'' (AMP; even-numbered algorithms in Table.~\ref{tab-pick},
Fig.~\ref{fig-dif} and subsequent figures), to a less restrictive picking
criterion where a paleopole is included in the current moving window if any part
of its age limits falls within that window, referred to hereafter as ``Age
Position Picking'' (APP; odd-numbered algorithms in Table.~\ref{tab-pick},
Fig.~\ref{fig-dif} and subsequent figures). The APP algorithm will pick more
paleopoles in each moving window than the AMP algorithm
(Figs.~\ref{fig-120NAhist}-\ref{fig-120AUhist}; Fig.~\ref{fig-nac-maplat}).

If, for example, we have a paleopole which is constrained to within 10 and 20 Ma
of age, and we have a 2 Myr moving window with a 1 Myr age step, then it
is included just in the 14\textendash16 Ma window (for the mid-point age of 15
Ma) for AMP\@. For APP, this paleopole falls in the 9\textendash11,
10\textendash12, 11\textendash13, 12\textendash14 \ldots 17\textendash19,
18\textendash20 and 19\textendash21 Ma windows. So the average poles are
produced from each window, and each original paleopole is represented over its
entire possible acquisition age.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{figures/binning.pdf}
\caption[Moving average (MA) methods]{An example of 10 Myr moving window and 5
Myr step in the two moving average methods, AMP and APP, based on poles of the
$NAC$. White circles are the midpoints of low and high magnetic ages. The
vertical axis has no specific meaning here. For example, for the window of 15 Ma
to 5 Ma (the dashed-line bin), the AMP method calculates the Fisher mean pole
(dark triangle in Fig.~\ref{fig-mhsPred}) of only 5 paleopoles, while the APP
method calculates the mean pole (dark circle in Fig.~\ref{fig-mhsPred}) of 9
paleopoles.}\label{fig-nac-maplat}
\end{figure}

A shorter step and narrower window will potentially increase the clustering of
the selected paleopoles, but will reduce their number. Conversely, a longer step
and wider window will increase the number of poles, but potentially decrease
their clustering. To investigate these trade-offs, every picking/filtering and
weighting method was also used to generate APWPs with a time step and window
doubled to 10 Myr and 20 Myr, respectively. Paths generated using AMP and APP
with no filtering, and every weighting method, with time steps from 1 Myr to 15
Myr in 1 Myr increments and window widths from 2 Myr to 30 Myr in 2 Myr
increments, were also analysed. In all cases the oldest time step was 120 Ma.

\subsubsection{Filtering}

14 different filters or corrections (Table.~\ref{tab-pick}) were applied to both
data picked using the AMP moving window method (even numbers) and data picked
using the APP moving window method (odd numbers), resulting in a total of 28
unique picking algorithms. The filters or corrections can be characterised as
follows:

\raggedright{Notes: SS05,~\cite{S05}}
\end{table}

\subparagraph{No modification (method 0/1).}

\subparagraph{Removal of poles with large spatial and temporal uncertainties
(method 2/3).} Paleopoles with both large $\alpha$95 (ED95 $>15\degree$,
following the BC02 threshold for the Mesozoic) and wide acquisition age limits
(difference between HIMAGAGE and LOMAGAGE $>20$ Myr, following the V90 criteria
about age within a half of a geological period; the average of the geological
periods between 120 and 0 Ma [Quaternary, Neogene, Paleogene and Cretaceous] is
about 20 Myr) which are less likely to provide a good estimate of the actual
pole position within any specific age window, were excluded.

\subparagraph{Prefer poles from igneous rocks (methods 4/5, 6/7).} Method 4/5
removes paleopoles potentially affected by inclination flattening by selecting
only paleopoles coded as igneous or mostly igneous (ROCKTYPE starting with
``intrusive'' or ``extrusive''). In fact, most of the paleopoles picked by
method 4/5 are derived from igneous-only rocks. Method 6/7 selects paleopoles
coded as containing igneous (ROCKTYPE containing ``intrusive'' or
``extrusive''); this is a less strict filter, because the dominant rock type
could potentially be another lithology. So method 6 includes also poles from
method 4, and method 7 includes poles from method 5.

\subparagraph{Correct sedimentary poles for inclination shallowing (method
8/9).} Rather than excluding paleopoles from sedimentary rocks, paleopoles coded
as sedimentary or redbeds were instead corrected for inclination flattening
using the flattening function $\tan I_o = f \tan I_f$~\cite{K55}, where $I_o$ is
the observed inclination, $I_f$ is the unflattened inclination, and $f$ is the
flattening factor (also known as shallowing coefficient; 1=no flattening,
0=completely flattened). Here $f=0.6$ is used in all cases,
following~\cite{T12}, unless when the rock type (ROCKTYPE field in the database)
is not sedimentary dominated but contains sedimentary, $f=0.8$ is used instead,
following the minimum anisotropy-of-thermal-remanence determined
f-correction~\cite{D11,Do11}.

\subparagraph{Remove redbeds (method 10/11) or correct them for inclination
shallowing (method 12/13).} Bias toward shallow inclinations is also observed
in paleomagnetic data derived from red-beds~\cite[e.g., in central Asia,
Mediterranean region, North America, etc.]{T04,K04,T07,B10}. This bias can be
addressed by removing the source (method 10/11; ROCKTYPE containing redbeds), or
correcting for inclination flattening, setting $f=0.6$ as previously described
(method 12/13). In the latter case, the assumption is being made that the
redbeds are carrying a detrital paleomagnetic signal.

\subparagraph{Prefer poles from younger (methods 14/15, 24/25) or older (method
16/17) studies.} Advancements in equipment (e.g., cryogenic magnetometers) and
analytical techniques (e.g., stepwise demagnetisation) mean that more recently
published paleopoles are potentially more reliable than older ones. Method 14/15
removes any paleopoles published prior to 1983 (YEAR $>$ 1983)\textemdash{}the
mean publication date for paleopoles in the GPMDB\@. Method 24/25 takes a
similar but less aggressive approach by excluding paleopoles that have been
superseded (99 datasets) by later studies from the same sequence, which are
presumed to represent a more accurate determination of the paleopole position.
Conversely, removing paleopoles published after 1983 (method 16/17; YEAR $\leq$
1983) should have a negative effect.

\subparagraph{Exclude suspected local rotations and secondary overprints
(method 18/19), or correct for them where possible (method 20/21).} Secondary
remanence components and local tectonic deformation can both displace the
measured pole position away from its ``true'' position. Such poles can be
identified based on demagnetisation data, or comparison to the pre-existing
APWP\@. Method 18/19 removes paleopoles that were identified as such in the
COMMENTS field (all the paleopoles affected by local rotations are picked out
by carefully going through all the datasets, including two groups with [19
datasets] and without [47 datasets] suggested corrections; the paleopoles
affected by secondary overprints are extracted with the keyword ``econd''
contained in the COMMENTS). A subset (19 datasets) of these paleopoles have a
suggested correction associated with them; method 20/21 retains these paleopoles
after applying the suggested correction.

\subparagraph{SS05 quality criteria (methods 22/23).} As with method 2/3,
SS05~\cite{S05} removes paleopoles with high spatial ($\alpha$95 $>15\degree$)
and temporal (age range $>$ 40 Myr) uncertainty, but additionally remove
paleopoles where samples had poor sampling coverage (sampling sites' quantity
[B] of $<4$, samples' quantity [N] of $<4$ times of the sites [B]) and were not
subjected to even a blanket demagnetisation treatment (laboratory cleaning
procedure code DEMAGCODE $<2$). Method 26/27 also uses these criteria, but
further excludes superseded data.

\subsubsection{Weighting}

Following filtering, weights were assigned to each of the remaining paleopoles
using one of the following six algorithms (Table~\ref{tab-weit}), prior to
calculation of a weighted Fisher mean:

\subparagraph{No weighting (Weighting 0).} Weighting factor=1 for all
paleopoles.

\subparagraph{Weighting by sample and site number (Weighting 1).} Paleopoles
derived from more individually oriented samples (observations; N) collected from
more sampling levels/sites (B) are more likely to average out secular variation
and accurately sample the GAD field~\cite{T19,v90,B02}, and are given a
weighting closer to 1. Unfortunately, in the GPMDB, not all paleopoles' B or N
are given. There are datasets with only number of sampling sites (B; at least
greater than 1) given, but no number of samples (N) or only one sample given, so
for this case, if B$>$1 and N $\leq$ 1, weight=$(1- \frac{1}{B})*0.5$ (for
120\textendash0 Ma North America, there are 8 such datasets, India 4, Australia
1). If only N (at least greater than 1) is given, and B is missing or only one,
i.e. B$\leq$ 1 and N$>$1, weight=$(1-\frac{1}{N})*0.5$ (for 120\textendash0 Ma
North America, there are 20 such datasets, India 26, Australia 22). If B $\leq$
1 and N $\leq$ 1 (there are only 23 datasets for the whole GPMDB 4.6b, including
18 with both B and N informations missing; for 120\textendash0 Ma North America,
India and Australia, there is no such dataset), weight=0.2.

\subparagraph{Weighting by age uncertainty (Weighting 2)} Above a maximum age
range that represents a well-constrained age, defined as half of each geological
period in the Phanerozoic Eon (e.g., Quaternary, Neogene)~\cite{v90,T19} or 15
Myr (the halves of the Paleogene, Cretaceous, and Jurassic periods are all at
least 20 Myr, which is large for these relatively young geologic periods),
whichever is smaller, paleopoles are given an increasingly small weight as the
age uncertainty (the high magnetic age $-$ the low magnetic age) increases.

\subparagraph{Weighting by spatial uncertainty (Weighting 3).} Paleopoles with a
smaller $\alpha$95 confidence ellipse are given a higher weighting than those
with a larger $\alpha$95, using a Gaussian/Normal distribution centered on 0
with standard deviation of 10. However, not all paleopoles' $\alpha$95 are given
in the database. If $\alpha$95 is not given, DP (the semi-axis of the confidence
ellipse along the great circle path from site to pole) is assigned as
$\alpha$95. If DP is also not given, $\alpha$95 was further approximated by
$\frac{140}{KD*N}$, where KD is Fisher precision parameter for mean direction if
this parameter is given, or Fisher precision parameter for Normal directions
(K\_NORM) if only K\_NORM is given when KD is missing. If N is not given, B is
used as N. If even K\_NORM is also missing, the lowest KD value 1.7 in GPMDB
4.6b is used as KD\@. It is also worthwhile to mention that if samples, where
two paleopoles are derived, are exactly from the same place and same rock, and
one $\alpha$95 is completely inside the other $\alpha$95, a zero is assigned as
the weight of the data with the larger $\alpha$95. In fact, in the above
described procedure A95 (circle of 95\% confidence about mean pole) is a better
alternative instead of $\alpha$95, because A95 is directly reflecting the
spatial uncertainty of the paleopoles. However, most paleopoles' A95s are not
given in GPMDB 4.6b, so $\alpha$95 is used instead since $\alpha$95 is also
indirectly reflecting the quality of the dataset.

\subparagraph{Weighting by degree of overlap between moving window and pole age
uncertainty (Weighting 4).} If a large fraction of the age range for an
individual paleopole falls within the current window, it is given a higher
weighting than a pole where the overlap is smaller, because it is more likely
to be close to the true pole position in the window interval. In other words, if
window intersects with part of age range, weight= (intersecting part) / (age
range width).

\subparagraph{Weighting by both spatial and temporal uncertainty (Weighting 5).}
This weighting method is a combination of No $3$ (but here the standard
deviation is 15 though) and No $4$. It takes the average of sums of the weights
generated by weighting methods 3 and 4.

Some of the picking (Table.~\ref{tab-pick}) and weighting
(Table.~\ref{tab-weit}) methods developed here are also connected with the V90 Q
factors mentioned above. For example, Pt 2, 3 and Wt 2, 4, 5 are related to the
V90 criteria 1; Pt 2, 3, 22, 23, 26, 27 and Wt 1, 3 are related to the V90
criteria 2; Pt 22 and 23 are related to the V90 criteria 3; The data
constraining described in Appendix A is related to the V90 criteria 5; and Pt 18
and 19 are related to the V90 criteria 7.

\subsection{Reference Paths}

A prediction of the expected APWP for any plate can be generated using a plate
kinematic model (e.g.\ the last c. 180\textendash200 Myr plate motions
reconstructed from spreading ridges in ocean basins) that is tied in to an
absolute reference frame. Here, we use the rotations of~\cite{O05}, which
describe motion of Nubia (plate ID 701) relative to the Indo-Atlantic hotspots.
Such an absolute frame of reference based on hot spots has been extended back to
120 Ma~\cite{O05}. North America is linked to this reference frame across the
Mid-Atlantic ridge, using North America-Nubia rotations from~\cite{D10} to
C-Sequence chron C1no (0.78 Ma), from~\cite{S12} to chron C2An.2n (2.7 Ma),
from~\cite{M99} to chron C5n.1ny (9.74 Ma), from~\cite{G13} to chron C5n.2o
(10.949 Ma), from~\cite{M99} to chron C6ny (19.05 Ma), from~\cite{G13} to chron
C6no (20.131 Ma), from~\cite{M99} to chron C34ny (83.5 Ma), from C34ny to about
118.1 Ma~\cite{S12}, and to closure at C34no (120.6 Ma)~\cite{G13}. India is
linked via the East African Rift Valley (Somalia-Nubia rotations to chron C1no
[0.78 Ma] from~\cite{D17}, to chron C2A.2no [3.22 Ma] from~\cite{H05}, and to
closure at C7.2m [25.01 Ma] from~\cite{R16} and C34 [85 Ma; Rowley, pers.\
comm.], and finally extended to 120 Ma because there was no known relative
motion between Somalia and Nubia from 120 Ma to 85 Ma according to the rotations
from~\cite{M16}); and Australia via the East African Rift Valley, SW Indian
Ridge (E Antarctica-Somalia rotations to chron C1no [0.78 Ma] from~\cite{D17},
to chron C2A.2no [3.22 Ma] from~\cite{H05}, to chron C5n.2no [10.95 Ma]
from~\cite{L02}, to chron C13ny [33.06 Ma] from~\cite{P08}, to chron C29no
[64.75 Ma] from~\cite{C10}, to chron C34y [83 Ma; Rowley, pers.\ comm.], to 96
Ma from~\cite{M01}, and to closure at M0 [120.6 Ma] from~\cite{M08}), and SE
Indian Ridge (Australia-East Antarctica rotations to chron C1no [0.78 Ma]
from~\cite{D17}, to chron C6no [20.13 Ma] from~\cite{C04}, to chron C8o [26 Ma]
from~\cite{G18}, to chron C17n.3no [38.11 Ma] from~\cite{C04}, to C34ny [83.5
Ma] from~\cite{Wh13}, to the Quiet Zone Boundary [96 Ma] from~\cite{W07}, to
closure at 136 Ma from~\cite{Wh13}). Above all, these kinematic models (see the
collected rotation data for the above-mentioned plate circuits in the
supplementary material) tied in to a hot spot absolute reference frame can
guarantee the oldest predicted poles for the three continents back to 120 Ma.

To reconstruct a reference APWP at the required time steps for comparison with
the paleomagnetic APWPs, rotations and their associated uncertainties were
interpolated between constraining finite rotation poles according to the method
of~\cite{D08}, assuming constant rates.

Neither the hotspot reference frame nor the paleomagnetic reference frame are
truly fixed with respect to the solid Earth. In the former case, hotspots are
not truly stationary in the mantle~\cite{S98}; in the latter, true polar wander
(TPW) may also lead to differential movements of the solid earth with respect to
the spin axis~\cite{E03}. In reality, it is difficult to untangle these effects.
Whilst there is little clear evidence for significant TPW in the past about 120
Myr~\cite{C00,R04}, modeling suggests that the effects of hotspot drift can
start to become significant over 80\textendash100 Myr timescales~\cite{O05}.
Because paleomagnetic APWPs have large associated spatial errors, a synthetic
APWP calculated using a fixed hotspot reference frame is unlikely to deviate
significantly from the `true' APWP, and most comparison experiments use a fixed
hotspot model (FHM) reference path for North America (Fig.~\ref{fig-mhsPred}),
India (Fig.~\ref{fig-mhsPred501}) and Australia (Fig.~\ref{fig-mhsPred801}).
However, the full set of comparisons for the 28 picking methods and 6 weighting
methods was also run for reference paths generated using the moving hotspot
model (MHM) rotations of~\cite{O05}, which incorporate motions of the
Indo-Atlantic hotspots relative to the mantle derived from mantle convection
modeling.

When comparing the synthetic APW paths for the three plates (inset,
Fig.~\ref{fig-mhsPred801}), there are clear differences. The predicted mean
north pole for North America at 120 Myr is still at about 75$^{\circ}$N
(Fig.~\ref{fig-mhsPred}), indicating rather slow drift with respect to the spin
axis; this is due to a large component of the North American plate's absolute
motion in the past 120 Myr being to the east. In contrast, the rapid northward
motion of the Indian plate in the same period, particularly prior to its
collision with Asia at about 50\textendash55 Ma~\cite{N10}, is reflected by the
120 Ma predicted mean north pole being located at about 20$^{\circ}$N
(Fig.~\ref{fig-mhsPred501}). Australia represents an intermediate case, with
north westerly plate motion from about 120\textendash60 Myr changing to more
rapid northward motion from about 60\textendash55 Ma to the present~\cite{W07}.
When comparing the FHM and MHM tracks, differences in the oldest parts (before
about 80 Ma) are apparent for India and North America.

These differences in the reference path due to different plate kinematics is
another variable that may affect the performance of the different weighting
algorithm for different plates, in addition to the distribution and type of the
contributing mean poles used to generate the paleomagnetic APWPs.

\subsection{Comparison Algorithm}

Comparisons between APWPs generated using different picking and weighting
algorithms and the synthetic reference APWPs were performed using the composite
path difference ($\mathcal{CPD}$) algorithm described in Chapter 2, with equal
weighting given to the spatial, length and angular differences (i.e., W$_s$ =
W$_l$ = W$_a$ = $\frac{1}{3}$).

This does not only help find the most similar paleomagnetic APWP (from the best
algorithm) to the reference APWP, but also help further test and demonstrate the
validness of the similarity measuring tool in practise.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Baseline results: 10 Myr window, 5 Myr step, fixed hotspot
reference}

Fig.~\ref{fig-dif} shows the $\mathcal{CPD}$ scores for the APWPs generated with
all 28 picking methods (AMP and APP with one of 14 separate filters applied) and
one of 6 weighted mean calculations then applied, compared to the FHM reference
path for North America (Fig.~\ref{fig-na-dif}), India (Fig.~\ref{fig-in-dif})
and Australia (Fig.~\ref{fig-au-dif}). The 27 lowest and highest of the 168
scores for each plate (values greater than 1 standard deviation from the mean)
are marked in green and red, respectively. Different combinations of windowing
method, filtering and weighting clearly affect the difference score, with
$\mathcal{CPD}$ values ranging from 0.0037 to 0.5137. The fits for paths with
low difference scores are clearly much better than for those with high ones
(Fig.~\ref{fig-difbw}). From Fig.~\ref{fig-dif}, it is clear that:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item There is much more variation in scores along the horizontal axes than
	the vertical axes, suggesting that the choice of windowing and filtering
	method has a much greater impact than weighting.
  \item Many of the highest scores (worst fits) are associated with
	even-numbered picking and filtering methods, i.e., those which use the AMP
	windowing algorithm.
  \item The magnitude and range of $\mathcal{CPD}$ scores for each of the three
	plates is different, with the North American plate having the lowest
	magnitudes and range (Fig.~\ref{fig-na-dif}), and the Indian plate having
	the highest (Fig.~\ref{fig-in-dif}).
  \item Although there is some overlap, the best- and worst-performing
	picking/filtering and weighting algorithms are not exactly the same for
	each plate.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Effects of windowing method}

Dividing $\mathcal{CPD}$ scores according to whether the AMP or APP windowing
method was used (Fig.~\ref{fig-difAMPvsAPP}) confirms that whilst the lowest
$\mathcal{CPD}$ scores for paths generated by the AMP windowing algorithm are
close to the lowest scores generated using the APP method, the highest scores
are much higher (Fig.~\ref{fig-boxAMPvsAPP}). The mean of the $\mathcal{CPD}$
scores for APWPs generated using AMP is greater than the maximum APP-derived
score for the Indian and Australian plates
(Figs.~\ref{fig-in-difAMPvsAPP},~\ref{fig-au-difAMPvsAPP},~\ref{fig-au-boxAMPvsAPP},~\ref{fig-au-boxAMPvsAPP}),
and more than 1 standard deviation greater than the APP mean for North American
APWPs (Figs.~\ref{fig-na-difAMPvsAPP},~\ref{fig-na-boxAMPvsAPP}).

labeled in green, more than one-standard-deviation interval labeled in

\end{figure*}

For each of the 84 possible combinations of filter method and weighting, the
AMP-derived score is typically 3-5 times higher than the equivalent APP-derived
score (Fig.~\ref{fig-boxAMPvsAPP}, insets). APP-generated paths yield a lower
$\mathcal{CPD}$ score than the equivalent AMP-generated path for 82 (97.6\%) of
the North America scores, 72 (85.7\%) of the India scores, and 84 (100\%) of the
Australia scores. For the North American and Indian plates, filtering that
prefers igneous poles (picking methods 4/5 and 6/7) or removes poles with large
age uncertainties (methods 2/3, 22/23 and 26/27) is most likely to produce AMP
scores close to (less than 1.5 times) or less than the APP scores
(Figs.~\ref{fig-na-difAMPvsAPP},~\ref{fig-in-difAMPvsAPP}). In the former case,
the scores are comparable and relatively low; in the latter case, they are
comparable but relatively high. For the Australian plate, only strict spatial
and temporal uncertainty filtering (method 2/3) and correcting for inclination
shallowing (method 8/9) produces comparable scores
(Fig.~\ref{fig-au-difAMPvsAPP}), producing comparable but moderate scores in
both cases.

\end{figure*}

On the North American plate, the APP-derived $\mathcal{CPD}$ score is most
likely to be significantly better (defined as more than 5 times higher) when
weighting methods 0 (no weighting) and 1 (by sample and site number) have been
applied (Fig.~\ref{fig-na-difAMPvsAPP}). This pattern is also seen for the
Australian plate, but removal of poles published after 1983 (picking method
16/17) also results in significantly better performance of the APP method
(Fig.~\ref{fig-au-difAMPvsAPP}). For the Indian plate, the largest difference
occurs when poles with suspected overprints or local rotations are removed
(picking method 18/19, Fig.~\ref{fig-in-difAMPvsAPP}).

\subsection{Effects of filtering and weighting}

When $\mathcal{CPD}$ scores are separated by windowing method
(Fig.~\ref{fig-difAMPvsAPP}), the effects of particular filtering and weighting
methods become easier to discern. In general, different filters (rows) produce
larger variations in scores than different weighting methods (columns). With
the exception of AMP-derived paths for India, the $\mathcal{CPD}$ score for
paths with no filtering (picking method 0/1) and no weighting (weighting method
0) is lower than the mean scores for that plate and windowing method. Therefore
filtering and weighting at best slightly improves, and at worst significantly
degrades, the APWP fit to the reference path.

\subsubsection{Filter aggression}

When considering the effects of filtering, it is important to consider how many
poles within the data set have been removed or corrected: if there is very
little alteration of the data set, little change from no filtering (methods
0/1) would be expected. In terms of the numbers of poles affected, the most
consequential filters are:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item removal of sedimentary poles (methods 4/5 and 6/7), which removes
        40-50\% of the dataset on all 3 plates, with the highest proportion
		being removed on the Indian plate. Although method 4/5 is more strict,
		it does not remove many more poles than method 6/7. Especially for North
		America and India, the numbers of the filtered paleopoles by method 4/5
		and 6/7 are actually the same.
  \item correction of sedimentary poles for inclination flattening (filter
		8/9), which affects 38-48\% of the dataset, with the highest affected
		proportion on the Indian plate.
  \item removal of poles with large temporal and spatial uncertainty (methods
		2/3, 22/23), particularly for the Australian plate, where the SS05
		filtering criteria removes about 70\% of the poles. Filter 26/27
		combines methods 22/23 and 24/25, but no or very few (in the case of
		Australia only 1 additional pole) are actually removed.
  \item filtering based on publication date (methods 14/15 and 16/17), with the
		ratio of pre/post 1983 poles varying from about 50/50 on the North
		American plate to 70/30 on the Australian plate.
\end{enumerate}

Conversely, filtering or correction for redbeds (methods 10/11 and 12/13),local
rotations and overprints (methods 18/19 and 20/21), or superseded data (method
24/25) affected 4\% or less of the poles on any plate.

\paragraph{10 Myr Binning and 5 Myr Stepping}

According to Fig.~\ref{fig-dif} and Fig.~\ref{fig-d-dif},
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the groups of picking-method-no 19 (APP with commented local-rotation or
        secondary-print studies excluded) and 21 (APP with local rotation
        excluded or corrected as suggested in the original sources)
        (Table.~\ref{tab-pick}) are among the best ones for all the three
        continents, while the groups of picking-method-no 2 (AMP with
        ``$\alpha$95/Age range'' no more than ``15\degree/20 Myr'') and 16 (AMP
        with only earlier-than-1983 studies), (Table.~\ref{tab-pick}) are among
        the worst for all them three.
  \item for both North America (101) and Australia (801), the groups of
        picking-method-no 1, 11, 13, 19, 21 and 25 (Table.~\ref{tab-pick}) are
        the best, and 2, 14, 16, 22 and 26 the worst. For both North America
		(101) and India (501), the groups of picking-method-no 5, 7, 19 and 21
		are the best, and 2, 8, 16 and 18 the worst. For both India (501) and
		Australia (801), the best 19, 21 and the worst 2, 16 are the same as the
		ones for all the three continents as above-mentioned. These results also
		further indicate that APP methods generally produce better similarity
		than AMP methods, however, the picking-method-no 4 is special, which is
		one of the AMP methods but also one of the best for India.
  \item the results of North America (101) and Australia (801) are closer
		(Fig.~\ref{fig-d-dif}).
  \item For North America and India, newer studies (later than 1983) give
		better results, whereas for Australia older studies (before 1983) give
		better results, mainly because the number of older studies (65;
		Fig.~\ref{fig-au-dif}) is much greater than the number of newer studies
		(27).
  \item Weighting influences more to APP than AMP, especially for the cases
		when there are plenty of paleopoles (e.g., for North America and
		Australia; Fig.~\ref{fig-difAMPvsAPP}). Wt 0 and 1 generally work well
		with APP.
  \item Lithology related picking methods (Pt 4\textendash13) are generally
		improving the fits, compared with other picking methods. However,
		sometimes, Wt 3 does not work well with these lithology-related methods
		(Fig.~\ref{fig-dif} and Fig.~\ref{fig-difAMPvsAPP}).

According to all the above results (Fig.~\ref{fig-dif} and
Fig.~\ref{fig-dif2010}), we can observe:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item generally the APP methods (adding data to a time window with overlapping
        age selection criterion) produce better similarities than the AMP
        methods (Table.~\ref{tab-bw}).
  \item the self-explanatory topography of bands indicates that the picking
        methods (Table.~\ref{tab-pick}) influence the similarity more than the
        weighting methods (Table.~\ref{tab-weit}) do.
  \item filtering (picking no 2\textendash7, 10, 11, and 14\textendash27) and
        correcting (picking no 8, 9, 12 and 13) has limited effectiveness.
  \item weighting is not always making similarities better. In fact, for quite
        many of the methods, no weighting is the best performer
		(Table.~\ref{tab-bw}).
  \item the picking method no 19 is always the best when the FHM predicted APWP
		is the reference.
  \item the weighting method no 0, 1 and 5 are generally producing better
        similarity than 2, 3 and 4.
  \item North America (101) owns better similarity results than Australia (801)
        and India (501), because its worst and mean composite differences are
		always less than the other two continents'.
  \item for both North America (101) and India (501), more recent studies
        generally give better results than (or results close to) older studies.
		However, this is not true for Australia (801) (Fig.~\ref{fig-au-dif}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Discussions}

The following discussions will be in Q\&A style.

\subsubsection{Question: Why the APP methods generally produce better
similarities than AMP methods do?}

Paleomagnetic (Mean) A95 represents precision (how well constrained calculated
poles are), and (mean) coeval poles' GCD represents accuracy (how close
calculated poles are to the reference path; Fig.~\ref{fig-A95GCD105F} and
Fig.~\ref{fig-A95SGCD105F}). Compared with AMP, APP usually improves both and
generates paths with higher accuracy and also higher precision (generally
increasing N).

The fact that APP increases the number of paleopoles (N) in each sliding window
would potentially average out some ``bad'' (i.e.\ inaccurate) poles and improves
the fit between the paleomagnetic APWPs and the model-predicted APWPs. The
general effects that APP brings include the decreases in paleomagnetic A95s,
or/and distances between compared coeval poles of paleomagnetic APWP and
reference APWP (Fig.~\ref{fig-A95mG105F} and Fig.~\ref{fig-A95mG105Fd}).
However, if the added paleopoles were all or mostly ``bad'', the improvement of
fit would not occur. So the improvement of fit is not only because of the
increase in N, but also because the majority of the additional poles are
``good''. AMP only regards the time uncertainty of each pole as one mid-point.
Then this mid-point is treated as the most likely age of that mean pole. This is
actually incorrect. The age uncertainty of paleopole is not obtained from a
probability density function derived from an observed frequency distribution. As
defined, the time uncertainty's lower (older) limit is a stratigraphic age, and
its upper (younger) limit could be also a stratigraphic age or be constrained by
a tectonic event using the field tests (e.g.\ fold/tilt test and conglomerate
test). So the true age of the pole could be any one that is not older than the
lower limit and also not younger than the upper limit. In other words, the
mid-point could be the true age of the pole, but it is not known as the most
likely age of that pole. If the mid-point is the most likely age of a pole, AMP
should generate a path that is closer to the reference. However, mostly APP
generates better similarities (See the high proportions of APP better than AMP
in Table.~\ref{tab-bw}). Most reasonably, the mid-point should be regarded as
one possibility of all uniformly (not necessarily normally bell shaped, or U
shaped, or left or right skewed) distributed ages between the two time limits.

So APP remains the effect of a paleopole borne on the mean poles during all the
period of its age uncertainty, and use the increased number of paleopoles (N)
to average out the negative effect of those ``bad'' poles, including the
paleopoles that should not be included at that age for mean pole.

\subsubsection{Question: Why the AMP methods sometimes unexceptionally produce
better similarities than APP methods do?}

Because of small number of paleopoles (not necessarily ``bad'') involved in
each sliding window, the produced mean poles by AMP should be relatively far
from its contemporary model-predicted pole. In other words, AMP intends to give
fairly small change in accuracy. This also could potentially bring more
distinguishable $d_s$ for AMP\@ if the corresponding A95 is not large enough.
For example, for Fig.~\ref{fig-na-dif}, there are only three special (of 84 APP
vs. AMP comparisons) cases picking/weighting 4/3, 4/5, 6/3 better than 5/3, 5/5,
7/3 respectively. Compared with the picking/weighting 4/3 APWP, although most of
the mean paleopoles are closer to the FHM predicted APWP and also the number of
the significant pole pairs is one less for the APP derived path (i.e. 5/3), the
A95s are smaller and most importantly there are one more significant $d_a$
orientation-change pair and two more significant $d_l$ segment pair
(Table.~\ref{tab-w3p4vs5}). If we observe carefully, it is because of the much
smaller 15 Ma A95 for 5/3. The similar phenomenon occurs to the case of 6/3 vs
7/3, a relatively much smaller paleomagnetic A95 causes more distinguishable
$d_a$ and $d_l$ for the APP results, and they offset the improvement of spatial
similarity $d_s$ APP brings.

For 4/5 vs 5/5, all $d_a$ and $d_l$ are indistinguishable. Compared with the
results from AMP, although the coeval pole GCDs are all decreased for APP, this
spatial improvement is not able to offset the negative effects of also
generally decreased paleomagnetic A95s, which potentially brings more
statistically distinguishable coeval poles (e.g.\ the 15 Ma and 30 Ma poles for
picking 5 and weighting 5; Table.~\ref{tab-w5p4vs5}). This further causes
greater distinguishable mean $d_s$ from the APP methods. The similar phenomenon
occurs to Fig.~\ref{fig-in-dif} picking 4 vs 5 with all the six types of
weightings, Fig.~\ref{fig-au-dif} picking/weighting 4/2\textendash3 vs
5/2\textendash3, 4/5 vs 5/5.

In addition, compared with AMP, APP potentially could generate more mean poles,
because sometimes for some sliding window there is no paleopole involved at all
for AMP\@ while there is(are) paleopole(s) involved for APP\@. For APP, the
mean poles at all ages should be composed of more paleopoles than it is for
AMP, which should generally decrease both coeval pole distance and paleomagnetic
A95. However, sometimes a rare case (e.g.\ the 0 Ma comparison shown in
Table.~\ref{tab-501w0p22vs23}) happens. It is sometimes that an additional
very ``bad'' paleopole gets included by APP and this increases both coeval pole
distance and paleomagnetic A95 even though N increases. Such cases include
Fig.~\ref{fig-in-dif} picking 22 vs 23 (actually exactly the same as picking 26
vs 27) with all the six types of weightings.

So generally as we discussed in the last section APP decreases the distances
between paleomagnetic APWPs and the hotspot and ocean-floor spreading model
predicted APWP, and also the uncertainties of paleomagnetic APWPs. However, as
we described in this section, special cases like decreased A95 potentially
intends to make coeval poles differentiated if the coeval poles' distance is
not decreased effectively or even increased, or very ``bad'' paleopoles got
involved in some sliding windows, occurs. In summary, when the negative effect
from these types of rare cases is beyond the positive effect the generally
improved mean poles contribute, the composite difference score would increase.
However, this phenomenon seldom occur (Table.~\ref{tab-bw}).

\subsubsection{Question: Why weighting is not affecting?}

Generally, weighting does not affect the similarities dramatically, because the
six results from the six weighting methods are mostly very close. There are a
few special cases that one of them dramatically changes similarity (e.g.\ for
picking method (Pk) 5 and weighting method (Wt) 3, etc.;
Fig.~\ref{fig-na-dif}). As follows, those normal cases with close results are
discussed first. Those rare cases are examined later.

For Pk 0 in the North America (101) example (Fig.~\ref{fig-na-dif}), the reason
of why Wt 1\textendash4 do not produce better similarity scores than Wt 0 (i.e.\
no weighting) does is examined here. Take the comparison between Wt 0 and Wt 1
(Table.~\ref{tab-101p0w0vs1}) as an example, although APP indeed decreases the
values of most distances from the reference and most A95s, APP also brings one
more significant differentiated segment-length difference (80\textendash85 Ma
coeval segments; Fig.~\ref{fig-101_8085}) because of the slightly larger A95 and
shorter coeval pole GCD for 80 Ma Pk 0 Wt 1. Although they are distinguishable,
the overlapping of their distributions is quite small
(Fig.~\ref{fig-nac105_00vs01dl}). Wt 2 and 4 cause one more pair of
distinguishable mean poles ($d_s$) than other weighting methods. However,
compared with Wt 0, Wt 5 (i.e.\ combination of $\alpha$95 and age error position
to bin) does affect and bring the best similarity, because Wt 5 decreases the
GCDs of the 20, 80 and especially 100 Ma distinguishable pole pairs (by more
than 2 degrees; Table.~\ref{tab-101p0w0vs1}).

\end{figure}

For Fig.~\ref{fig-na-dif} Pk 1, Wt 0 generates the best similarity. Wt
2\textendash5 cause at least 3 more pairs of distinguishable mean poles ($d_s$)
than other weighting methods. Wt 1 increases the GCDs of all the distinguishable
pole pairs (0, 5 and 120 Ma).

For Fig.~\ref{fig-na-dif} Pk 2, Wt 0 generates the best similarity. Wt
1\textendash5 cause at least 1 more pair of distinguishable mean poles ($d_s$)
than Wt 0 (60 Ma). Wt 4 also increases another pair of distinguishable mean 
poles ($d_s$) (80 Ma).

As the above examples shown, although no weighting is often better than
weighting, the results are actually rather close to each other and also APP
still improves precision and accuracy of most poles for the cases with larger
difference scores, although APP brings extra significant differences in shape
metrics which is also the main cause of their larger difference scores
(Table.~\ref{tab-101p0w0vs1}). However, APP does not always improves precision
or accuracy, for example, for the Pt 5 (mainly or only igneous derived) and Wt 3
(according to $\alpha$95) results (Table.~\ref{tab-101p5}). For Pt 5, the result
with no weighting is still the best, and the results from Wt 0\textendash2, 4, 5
are close and APP generally improves precision and accuracy, just like the above
mentioned general cases. Only for Wt 3, APP worsens precision and improves
accuracy of most poles at the same time. This makes the difference score
dramatically larger than others. In addition, Wt 3 brings more significant
differences in shape metrics, which causes the difference score even larger
(Table.~\ref{tab-101p5}). That Wt 3 sometimes gives dramatical worse similarity
could be related to the way we do the weighting according to the size of
$\alpha$95, i.e.\, the smaller the $\alpha$95 is, the larger the assigned
weight is (see more details about Weighting No. 3 in the Weighting paragraph).
However, small size of $\alpha$95 (high accuracy) could be becausei of those
sampled directions not covering enough long period (thought to be at least about
$10^4$ years) to ``average out'' secular variation for giving a paleopole. That
is to say, the smallest $\alpha$95s could get the greatest weights that they
should not deserve.

Generally, weighting does not improve fit. In other words, Wt 0 is generaly the
best. Wt 2 or 4 is not recommended, because they never have generated the best
similarities (Table.~\ref{tab-bw}), compared with other weighting methods. There
is no general pattern about which weighting (of Wt 1\textendash5) is better or
worse. So weighting, for making a paleomagnetic APWP, is not absolutely
necessary. However, there are some patterns about which weighting is better or
worse for some specific continent. For example, Wt 3 prefers Australia
(Table.~\ref{tab-bw}). Wt 3 works fine with India. However, Wt 3 is not
recommended for North America.

\subsubsection{Question: Why best and worst methods are not consistent?}
\paragraph{Question: Why the picking method 21 is not among the best for
20 Myr binning and 10 Myr stepping with both space and shape tested?}

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-dif}, both the picking methods 19 and 21 are among the
best. However, the picking method 21 is not one of the best any more for 20 Myr
binning and 10 Myr stepping with both space and shape tested
(Fig.~\ref{fig-dif2010}). Further, in fact, in Fig.~\ref{fig-dif2010}, we can
see the picking method 21 is still one of the best for North America (101) and
Australia (801), but just not for India (501). However, even for India (501),
the difference values (ranging 0.0483\textendash0.0535) produced by the picking
method 21 are still closer to the left bound of the one-standard-deviation
interval 0.0359\textendash0.1072 and relatively farther from the mean 0.074,
which means the picking method 21 is still a relatively better one.


\subsubsection{Question: Are there particular parts of the path that are more
variable? Do different methods affect different parts of the path differently?}

The results may highlight the trade-off between more data diluting the effect of
outliers, and fewer but `better' data being more easily affected by a bad point
that gets through the filters (Fig.~\ref{fig-nads}, Fig.~\ref{fig-nadl} and
Fig.~\ref{fig-nada}).

\subsubsection{Question: Do time window size and step affect the results?}

A balance needs to be made between having windows that are too wide and steps
that are too long which will smooth the data so much we miss actual details in
the APWP (e.g.\ those 20 Myr window 10 Myr step paleomagnetic paths in
Fig.~\ref{fig-dif2010bw} and even 30/15 Myr window and step;
Table.~\ref{tab-pk0vs1bs} and Fig.~\ref{fig-WinStpVsCPD}) and windows that are
too narrow and steps that are too short which introduces noise by having too few
poles in each window (e.g.\ 2 Myr window 1 Myr step; Table.~\ref{tab-pk0vs1bs}
and Fig.~\ref{fig-WinStpVsCPD}). There is a dependence here on data density:
higher density allows smaller windows/steps (this is one of the things we want
to test with selective data removal mentioned in Chapter 4). Fitting curves by
moving averaging change with different time window lengths and time increment
lengths (i.e.\ steps) (e.g., the similarity of the pair in
Fig.~\ref{fig-au-2010223} is improved a bit compared to
Fig.~\ref{fig-au-105223}). A variety of ways of binning the data (here
30\textendash2 Myr window size and half of the size as step) are being tested to
see which one produces the better and more appropriately smoothed fit.

For Pk 2 (AMP with ``$\alpha$95/Age range'' no more than
``15\degree/20\degree''), the 20/10 Myr bin/step methods always generate better
similarities than the 10/5 Myr ones (e.g.\ Fig.~\ref{fig-na-dif2010} versus
Fig.~\ref{fig-na-dif}).

Interestingly, only for North America, the 10/5 Myr bin/step methods generally
and unexceptionally produce better similarities than the 20/10 Myr methods do
(Fig.~\ref{fig-f105d2010}), which mainly depends on the picking methods. Note
that as mentioned in Appendix A and also Chapter 4, there are 135, 75 and 99
paleopoles that compose of 120\textendash0 Ma APWPs of North America, India and
Australia respectively. Does the reason could be because of the relatively
larger number of paleopoles for North America? Since theoretically for each
sliding window, the more ``bad'' paleopoles it contains, the worse similarity
we should obtain. In the contrary, the less paleopoles the window contains, the
weaker the effect of averaging out ``bad'' poles' influence would be. So is
there a threshold number of paleopoles for making an paleomagnetic APWP\@? For
example, for making a 120\textendash0 Ma APWP, do the results indicate the best
number of paleopoles we need should be some value between 99 and 135? We did
the test in Chapter 2 on the 530\textendash0 Ma paleomagnetic APWP using the AMP
method, and we did find that longer windows and steps bring the paleomagnetic
APWPs closer to the reference path. Here another test will be implemented as
follows. With the results from the 10/5 and 20/10 bin/step together, 2/1, 4/2,
6/3, 8/4, 12/6, 14/7, 16/8, 20/10, 24/12 and 30/15 Myr bin/step will be used to
generate paleomagnetic APWPs for North America, India and Australia to see which
one would make the paleomagnetic APWP closest to the reference paths. Will the
similarities they generate be generally worse than those the 10/5 Myr bin/step
generates? Or will they be better first and then worse than those the 10/5 Myr
bin/step generates when the bin/step sizes increase up to 20/10 Myr? For the
best results (Table.~\ref{tab-pk0vs1bs}), as expected, AMP needs wider sliding
window and step to get close to the reference while APP does not
(Fig.~\ref{fig-WinStpVsCPD}). Even the best sizes of sliding window and step are
assigned for AMP, the results from APP are still much better than those from
AMP\@. Picking methods (directly related to N) are still the key influence
factor of choosing a better sliding window size and step size of moving
averaging, although weighting methods are also important.

\paragraph{Conclusions:}

\subparagraph{If AMP has to be used, better results can be obtained through
using large sizes of sliding window and step, commonly more than 24/12 Myr. In
addition, we should be cautious when Wt 3 is used with AMP.}

\subparagraph{APP is recommended, not only because the temporal uncertainty is
incorporated into the algorithm but also the results from APP are not as that
sensitive as AMP to the changes of sliding window and step sizes. In fact, for
APP the results from different window and step sizes are much more stable than
those from AMP (Fig.~\ref{fig-WinStpVsCPD}). This means we actually do not need
to worry about what sizes should be chosen for the sliding window and step when
we use APP method.}


\subsubsection{Question: Is there any difference between choosing FHM and MHM
as the reference path?}

The differences (Fig.~\ref{fig-dmf}) are all lower than 0.041, and most are less
than 0.01. That indicates the uncertainties of paleomagnetic mean poles are
relatively large enough to make uses of Fixed and Moving Hotspot Models as
references not quite differentiated. So far choosing Fixed or Moving model is
not a priority.

	results from FHM (Fig.~\ref{fig-dif}) and MHM (Fig.~\ref{fig-difm}) as

\end{figure*}

However, through looking at the signs of these differences
(Fig.~\ref{fig-dmf}), for North America (Fig.~\ref{fig-mf101}), FHM and the
North America\textendash{}Nubia\textendash{}Mantle plate circuit derived
path is a better reference option in general, while for both India
(Fig.~\ref{fig-mf501}) and Australia (Fig.~\ref{fig-mf801}), MHM and the related
plate circuit derived path is a generally better choice.


\section{Final Conclusions}

From the perspective of the general similarities between those paleomagnetic
APWPs and the hot spot model and ocean-floor spreading model predicted APWPs,
GAD hypothesis is proved valid for at least the last 120 Myr.

\subsection{Universal Rules of Ways of Processing Paleomagnetic Data:}
%
\begin{description}
  \item Although effects of filters (all the picking methods except Pk 1) have
		marginal change in reducing N (precision going down), some filters do
		improve the similarity score generally, for example, Pt 11 (APP without
		redbed-derived data) and 13 (APP with redbed-derived data corrected) are
		better than Pt 0 for all the three continents.
  \item APP is better than AMP for making paleomagnetic APWPs, for both kinds
		of situations when there are lots of data (APP even better, e.g.\ for
		North America and Australia) and not much data (APP still a better
		option, e.g.\ for India; Table.~\ref{tab-bw}). APP with filters (Pt
		3, 5, 7, 9, 11, \ldots, 27) is generally worse than APP without any
		filter (Pt 1).
  \item Weighting is actually not affecting, and in some cases makes it much
		worse, for example, likely worse for the combined methods of Wt 3 and
		AMP.
  \item APP itself helps incorporate temporal uncertainty into the algorithm.
		With the bootstraps test helping incorporate spatial uncertainty into
		the algorithm together, both spatial and temporal uncertainties are
		successfully considered in APP methods.
\end{description}

\subsection{Conditional Rules of Ways of Processing Paleomagnetic Data:}
%
\begin{description}
  \item Picking method no. 16 (AMP with data from old studies) is not
		recommended, e.g.\ before 1983) for generating a paleomagnetic APWP.
\end{description}

\subsection{Summary}

According to the results we have from the three continents, North America, India
and Australia, using the similarity measuring tool developed in Chapter 2, it is
recommended that APP should be used to select the input paleopoles. According to
all the paleomagnetic data we have from the three continents, the results from
any size for sliding window and step are interestingly and extremely close to
each other when the APP method is used, compared with the results from the AMP
method (Table.~\ref{tab-pk0vs1bs} and Fig.~\ref{fig-WinStpVsCPD}). So any size
for binning and stepping is ok when APP is used. Then filtering is actually not
necessary. However, some filtering methods (e.g.\ Picking No. 5, 7
(igneous-derived), 11, 13 (nonredbeds or corrected redbeds derived), 19, 21
(non-local-rotation/reprinted or corrected-rotation derived) and 25
(non-superseded data derived)) are fine too and will not give worst or worse
results than the other filtering methods (i.e.\ the left Picking methods). With
APP used, weighting is actually not necessary either. If a weighting has to be
used, Weighting No. 1 (related to the number of paleomagnetic sampling sites and
observations) is generally better than the other four given weighting methods
(Fig.~\ref{fig-flow}).

If AMP has to be used, relatively wide sliding window and step are needed.
According to our tests, more than 20/10 Myr is recommended. In addition, AMP
works relatively better with igneous-derived data (i.e.\ Picking No. 4 and 6),
which indicates that if we have fewer data, these data need to be better in
quality (Fig.~\ref{fig-flow}).

\section{Constrain Paleopoles For A Certain Tectonic Plate}

A polygon can be drawn around a set of paleomagnetic data, whose sampling sites
we believe belong to a specific plate or rigid block. Then the {\em Spatial
Join\/} technique~\cite{J07} helps join attributes from the polygon to the
paleomagnetic data based on the spatial relationship allowing data within this
polygon to be extracted from the whole raw large dataset without splitting a
subset just for a specific plate. That allows us to quickly select subsets of
the database based on geographic constraints just as easily as for age. Of
course, the boundary of this polygon must be reasonably along a tectonic
boundary. Regions like those close to the plate boundaries are usually
tectonically active (e.g.\ local rotations), so we should also be careful when
we deal with the paleopoles derived from this type of locations.

\subsection{120\textendash0 Ma North America}

The data-constraining polygons are from the recently published plate
model~\cite{Y18} (Fig.~\ref{fig_NAfinal}). Plate ID 101 polygon in the
recently published Plate Model~\cite{Y18}, including its children 108
(Avalon/Acadia block) and 109 (Piedmont block) polygons for 120\textendash0 Ma,
is used to select the sampling sites of the paleopoles for North America.
According to the plate model rotation data~\cite{Y18}, 108 is fixed to 101
during the geologic period from Cretaceous to the present day. 109 is also fixed
to 101 since about 300 Ma~\cite{C14}. Then in order to be compared with the FHM
(120\textendash0 Ma)~\cite{M93,M99}, the paleopoles with age ranging
120\textendash0 Ma are further selected through constraining the lower magnetic
age ``LOMAGAGE $<=$ 135'' (here it is not 120 but 135, because for the lower
resolution case when the window length is 30 Myr, the Age Position Picking
method will include those data with their lower magnetic age between 120 Ma and
135 Ma). In addition, the RESULTNO=6007 dataset should also be included
according to a published plate kinematic model~\cite{Mc06}
with a relatively higher resolution of polygons and
rotations, although the dataset is in the PlateID=178 polygon. In the end, 193
datasets in total are extracted (both white circles and red
triangle-inside-circles in Fig.~\ref{fig_NAfinal}).

Also based on this model of southwestern North America since 36 Ma~\cite{Mc06},
part of the paleopoles constrained by the four small western terranes whose
Plate IDs are also 101 (white circles in Fig.~\ref{fig_NAfinal}) in fact had gone through regional
rotations and here are removed. However, the poles with age younger than 10 Ma
located within the largest western 101 terrane (on the south of the smallest
western 101 terrane; corresponding to the RANGE\_ID=74 polygon in the
model~\cite{Mc06}) should be included. So finally 135 of the 193 datasets remain
(Fig.~\ref{fig_NAfinal}). Spatially North American paleomagnetic data are mainly
from the western and eastern margins of the plate.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{figures/Appendix/101.pdf}
\caption{The final filtered datasets (red triangle-inside-circles) for later
analysis on 120\textendash0 Ma North America. Those poles that had been
influenced by local tectonic rotations are shown as white
circles.}\label{fig_NAfinal}
\end{figure}

\subsection{120\textendash0 Ma India}

Plate ID 501 polygons in the recently published Plate Model~\cite{Y18} also
include the two small polygons of the northern ``Lesser Himalayan passive
margin of Greater Indian Basin'' and ``Tethyan Himalayan microcontinent of
Greater India'' (Fig.~\ref{fig_INfinal}). The polygons are used to select the
sampling sites of the paleopoles for India (Fig.~\ref{fig_INfinal}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{figures/Appendix/501.pdf}
\caption{The final filtered datasets (red triangle-inside-circles) for later
analysis on 120\textendash0 Ma India. Those poles that had been influenced by
local tectonic rotations are shown as white circles. The rifts, faults and
detachments (red lines) around India are used to filter out those data that
are influenced by local tectonic rotations.}\label{fig_INfinal}
\end{figure}

Based on the model of the tectonic interactions between India, Arabia and Asia
since the Jurassic~\cite{G15} (Fig.~\ref{fig_INfinal}), part of the paleopoles
constrained by the north two small terranes whose Plate IDs are also 501 in fact
had gone through regional rotations and here are removed. So finally 75 datasets
are left (Fig.~\ref{fig_INfinal}). Spatially Indian paleomagnetic data are more
evenly distributed on the India plate than North American and Australian poles.

\subsection{120\textendash0 Ma Australia}

Plate ID 801 polygon in the recently published Plate Model~\cite{Y18}, including
its children 675 (Sumba block) and 684 (Timor block) polygons for
120\textendash0 Ma (Fig.~\ref{fig_AUfinal}), is used to select the sampling
sites of the paleopoles for Australia. According to the plate model rotation
data~\cite{Y18}, 675 and 684 are fixed to 801 during the geologic period from
c.145 Ma to the present.

On the southeast of the main Australia plate (the blue polygon in
Fig.~\ref{fig_AUfinal}), there is a triangle-shaped small polygon 850
(Tasmania block) which is fixed to 801 since c.100 Ma according to
the~\cite{Y18} rotation data. With that attribute, 805 contributes more data
younger than c.100Ma for the later analysis. Ultimately the final 99 extracted
datasets is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_AUfinal}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{figures/Appendix/801.pdf}
\caption{The final filtered datasets (red triangle-inside-circles) for later
analysis on 120\textendash0 Ma Australia. Those poles that had been influenced
by local tectonic rotations are shown as white circles. The Plate ID 850 helps
increase the amount of qualified datasets for 100\textendash0
Ma.}\label{fig_AUfinal}
