\section{Introduction}

APWPs are generated by combining paleomagnetic poles for a particular rigid
block over the desired age range to produce a smoothed path.

\subsection{Not All Data Are Created Equal}

However, uncertainties in the age and location of paleomagnetic poles can vary
greatly for different poles.

\subsubsection{Age Error}

Although remanent magnetizations are generally assumed to be primary, many
events can cause remagnetisation (in which case the derived pole is `younger'
than the rock). If an event that has occurred since the rock's formation that
should affect the magnetisation (e.g., folding, thermal overprinting due to
intrusion) can be shown to have affected it, then it constrains the
magnetisation to have been acquired before that event. Recognising or ruling
out remagnetisations depends on these field tests, which are not always
performed or possible. Even a passed field test may not be useful if field test
shows magnetisation acquired prior to a folding event tens of millions of years
after initial rock formation.

The most obvious characteristic we can observe from paleomagnetic data is that
some poles have very large age ranges, e.g., more than 100 myr. The
magnetization age should be some time between the information of the rock and
folding events. There are also others where we have similar position but the
age constraint is much narrower, e.g. 10 myr window or less. Obviously the
latter kind of data is more valuable than the one with large age range.

\subsubsection{Position Error}

The errors of pole latitudes and longitudes are 95\% confidence ellipses,
which also vary greatly in magnitude. All paleomagnetic poles have some
associated uncertainties due to measurement error and the nature of the
geomagnetic field. More uncertainties can be added by too few samples,
sampling spanning too short a time range to approximate a GAD field, failure
to remove overprints during demagnetisation, etc.

\subsubsection{Data Consistency}

Paleomagnetic poles of a rigid plate or block should be continuous time series.
For a rigid plate, two poles with similar ages shouldn't be dramatically
different in location. Sometimes, this is the case. Sometimes we have further
separated poles with close ages.

There are a number of possible causes for these outliers, including:

\verb"Lithology"

For poor consistency of data, it is potentially because of different
inclinations or declinations. The first thing we should consider about is
their lithology. We want to check if the sample rock are igneous or
sedimentary, because sediment compaction can result in anomalously shallow
inclinations~\cite{T16}. In addition, we also can check if the rock are
redbeds or non-redbeds. Although whether redbeds record a detrital signal or a
later Chemical Remanent Magnetization (CRM) is still somewhat controversial,
both sedimentary rocks and redbeds could lead to inconsistency in direction
compared to igneous rocks.

\verb"Local Rotations"

Local deformation between two paleomagnetic localities invalidates the rigid
plate assumption and could lead to inconsistent VGP directions. So if
discordance is due to local deformation, and we would ideally want to exclude
such poles from our APWP calculation.

\verb"Other Factors"

In most cases, mean pole age (centre of age error) has just been binned. If
any of the poles have large age errors, they could be different ages from each
other and sample entirely different parts of the APWP\. Conversely, if any of
the poles have too few samples, or were not sampled over enough time to average
to a GAD field, a discordant pole may be due to unreduced secular variation.

\subsubsection{Data Density}

As we go back in time, we have lower quality and lower density (or quantity) of
data, for example, the Precambrian or Early Paleozoic paleomagnetic data are
relatively fewer than Middle-Late Phanerozoic ones, and most of them are not
high-quality, e.g., larger errors in both age and location. The combination of
lower data quality with lower data density means that a single `bad' pole (with
large errors in age and/or location) can much more easily distort the
reconstructed APWP, because there are few or no `good' poles to counteract its
influence.

Data density also varies between different plates. E.g., we have a relatively
high density of paleomagnetic data for North American Craton (NAC), but few
poles exist for Greenland and Arabia. Based on mean age (mean of lower and
upper magnetic ages), for 100\textendash0 Ma, GPMDB 4.6b has 198 NAC poles, but
only 17 for Greenland and 24 for Arabia.

\subsubsection{Publication Year}

The time when the data was published should also be considered, because
magnetism measuring methodology, technology and equipments have been improved
since the early 20th century. For example, stepwise demagnetisation, which is
the most reliable method of detecting and removing secondary overprints, has
only been in common use since the mid 1980s.

In summary, not all paleomagnetic poles are created equal, which leads to an
important question: how to best combine poles of varying quality into a
coherent and accurate APWP\? Paleomagnetists have proposed a variety of methods
to filter so-called ``bad'' data, or give lower weights to those ``bad'' data
before generating an APWP, e.g., two widely used methods: the V90 reliability
criteria~\citep{v90} and the BC02 selection criteria~\citep{B02}. Briefly, the
V90 criteria for paleomagnetic results includes seven criteria: (1) Well
determined age; (2) At least 25 samples with Fisher~\citep{F53} precision
$\kappa$ greater than 10 and $\alpha95$ less than 16°; (3) Detailed
demagnetisation results reported; (4) Passed field tests; (5) Tectonic
coherence with continent and good structural control; (6) Identified antipodal
reversals; (7) Lack of similarity with younger poles~\citep{T92}.
Compared with V90, the BC02 criteria suggests stricter filtering, e.g., using
only poles with at least 6 sampling sites and 36 samples, each site having
$\alpha95$ less than 10° in the Cenozoic and 15° in the Mesozoic. But there has
been limited study of how effective these filtering methods are at
reconstructing a `true' APWP, and for most studies after a basic filtering of
`low quality' poles, the remaining poles are, in fact, treated equally.

\section{Using the GJI class file}

If the file \verb"gji.cls" is not already in the appropriate system directory
http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journals/gji under {\em Author Guidelines}.

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{gji}
\end{verbatim}
In general, the following standard document class options should {\em not\/} be
used with the GJI style:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{10pt}, \texttt{11pt}, \texttt{12pt} \textendash{} unavailable;
  \item \texttt{twoside} (no associated style file) \textendash{}
     \texttt{twoside} is the default;
   \item \texttt{fleqn}, \texttt{leqno}, \texttt{titlepage} \textendash{} should
     not be used (\verb"fleqn" is already incorporated into the GJI style);
  \item \texttt{twocolumn} \textendash{} is not necessary as it is the default
    style.
\end{enumerate}

In \LaTeX2e the use of postscript fonts and the inclusion of non-standard
options is carried out through the \verb"\usepackage" command, rather than as
including
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{times}
\end{verbatim}
on the line immediately after the \verb"\documentclass". If necessary,
\texttt{ifthen} and \texttt{bezier} can be included as packages.

\verb"lfonts.tex" that is distributed as part of \LaTeX. If you have access to
the source file for this guide, \verb"gjilguid2e.tex", attempt to typeset it.
of \verb"lfonts.tex" has been installed in your system.

\subsection{Additional document class options}\label{classoptions}

The following additional class options are available with the GJI style:
\begin{description}
  \item \texttt{onecolumn} \textendash{} to be used \textit{only} when two-column output
        is unable to accommodate long equations;
  \item \texttt{landscape} \textendash{} for producing wide figures and tables which
        need to be included in landscape format (i.e.\ sideways) rather
        than portrait (i.e.\ upright). This option is described below.
  \item \texttt{doublespacing} \textendash{} this will double-space your
        article by setting \verb"\baselinestretch" to 2.
  \item \texttt{referee} \textendash{} 12/20pt text size, single column,
        designed for submission of papers.
  \item \texttt{mreferee} \textendash{} 11/17pt text size, single column
        designed for submission of papers with mathematical content.
  \item \texttt{camera} \textendash{} designed for use with computer modern fonts to
        produce a closer representation of GJI style for camera
        ready material.
  \item \texttt{galley} \textendash{} no running heads, no attempt to align
        the bottom of columns.
\end{description}


\subsection{Landscape pages}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use the \verb"table*" or \verb"figure*" environments in your
        need to key in the three lines which are marked with \verb"\% **",
        with an appropriate headline.
\begin{verbatim}
% ** \clearpage
% ** \thispagestyle{plate}
% ** \plate{Opposite p.~812, GJI, \textbf{135}}
\begin{figure*}
  \vbox to220mm{\vfil Landscape figure to
                go here. \vfil}
  \caption{}
  \label{landfig}
\end{figure*}
\end{verbatim}
\item Create a separate document with the corresponding document style
      but also with the \verb"landscape" document style option, and
      include the \verb"\pagestyle" command, as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[landscape]{gji}
\pagestyle{empty}
\end{verbatim}
  \item Include your complete tables and illustrations (or space for
        these) with captions using the \verb"table*" and \verb"figure*"
        environments.
  \item Before each float environment, use the
        \verb"\setcounter" command to ensure the correct numbering of
        the caption. For example,
\begin{verbatim}
\setcounter{table}{0}
\begin{table*}
 \begin{minipage}{115mm}
 \caption{Images of global seismic tomography.}
 \label{tab1}
 \begin{tabular}{@{}llllcll}
   :
 \end{tabular}
 \end{minipage}
\end{table*}
\end{verbatim}
The corresponding example for a figure would be:
\begin{verbatim}
\clearpage
\setcounter{figure}{12}
\begin{figure*}
 \vspace{144mm}
 \caption{Travel times for regional model.}
 \label{fig13}
\end{figure*}
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Additional facilities}

In addition to all the standard \LaTeX\ design elements, the GJI style
includes the following features.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Extended commands for specifying a short version of the title and
        author$(s)$ for the running headlines;
  \item A \verb"summary" environment to produce a suitably indented
        Summary
  \item An \verb"abstract" environment which produces the GJI style of
        Summary
  \item A \verb"keywords" environment and a \verb"\nokeywords" command;
  \item A starred version of the \verb"\caption" command to produce
        captions for continued figures or tables.
 \end{enumerate}
 In general, once you have used the additional \verb"gji.cls" facilities
in your document, do not process it with a standard \LaTeX\ style file.

\subsection{Titles and author's name}

must be a single line ($\leqslant 45$ characters). Moreover, the main
heading can also incorporate new line commands (e.g. \verb"\\") but
name, the standard \verb"\title" and \verb"\author" commands have been
following code:
\begin{verbatim}
\title[Geophys.\ J.\ Int.:
       \LaTeXe\ Guide for Authors]
  {Geophysical Journal International:
   \LaTeXe\ style guide for authors}
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
\author[B.L.N. Kennett]
   {B.L.N. Kennett$^1$
  \thanks{Pacific Region Office, GJI} \\
  $^{1}$Research School of Earth Sciences,
    Australian National University,
    Canberra ACT \emph{0200}, Australia
  }
\end{verbatim}
The \verb"\thanks" note produces a footnote to the title or author.

\subsection{Key words and Summary}

usual way using the \verb"\maketitle" command. Immediately following
words. The summary should be enclosed within an \verb"summary"
\verb"keywords" environment. For example, the titles for this guide
\begin{verbatim}
\maketitle
\begin{summary}
 This guide is for authors who are preparing
 papers for \textit{Geophysical Journal
 International} using the \LaTeXe\ document
 preparation system and the GJI style file.
\end{summary}
\begin{keywords}
 \LaTeXe\ -- class files: \verb"gji.cls"\ --
 sample text -- user guide.
\end{keywords}

\section{Introduction}
  :
\end{verbatim}
The heading `\textbf{Key words}' is included automatically and the key words are
should insert the \verb"\nokeywords" command immediately after the end of the
\verb"summary" or \verb"abstract" environment. This ensures that the vertical
space after the abstract and/or title is correct and that any \verb"thanks"
\begin{verbatim}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  :
\end{abstract}
\nokeywords

\section{Introduction}
  :
\end{verbatim}

Note that the \verb"summary" and \verb"abstract" environments have the same
effect for the documentclass \verb"gji.cls"

\subsection{Lists}

The GJI style provides numbered lists using the \verb"enumerate" environment and
unnumbered lists using the \verb"description" environment with an empty label.
Bulleted lists are not part of the GJI style and the \verb"itemize" environment
should not be used.

The enumerated list numbers each list item with roman numerals:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item first item
  \item second item
  \item third item
\end{enumerate}
number labelling command after the \verb"\begin{enumerate}". For example, the
list
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{(\arabic{enumi})}
  \item first item
  \item second item
  \item etc\ldots
\end{enumerate}
was produced by:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{enumerate}
 \renewcommand{\theenumi}{(\arabic{enumi})}
  \item first item
       :
\end{enumerate}
\end{verbatim}
Unnumbered lists are provided using the \verb"description" environment. For
example,
\begin{description}
  \item First unnumbered item which has no label and is indented from the left
        margin.
  \item Second unnumbered item.
  \item Third unnumbered item.
\end{description}
was produced by,
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{description}
 \item First unnumbered item...
 \item Second unnumbered item.
 \item Third unnumbered item.
\end{description}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Captions for continued figures and tables}

two floats; the second float should use the \verb"caption*" command with a
suitable caption:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}
 \caption*{-- \textit{continued}}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lccll}
  :
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}

 \begin{figure}
     \vspace{5.5cm}
     \caption{An example figure in which space has been left for the artwork.}\label{sample-figure}
  \end{figure}

\section[]{Some guidelines for using\\* standard facilities}

\subsection{Sections}

\LaTeX\ provides five levels of section headings and they are all defined in the
GJI style file:
\begin{description}
  \item \verb"\section"
  \item \verb"\subsection"
  \item \verb"\subsubsection"
  \item \verb"\paragraph"
  \item \verb"\subparagraph"
\end{description}

Section numbers are given for section, subsection, subsubsection and paragraph
need any other style, see the example in Section~\ref{headings}.

If you find your section/subsection (etc.)\ headings are wrapping round, you
must use the \verb"\\*" to end individual lines and include the optional
argument \verb"[]" in the section command. This ensures that the turnover is
flushleft.

\subsection{Illustrations (or figures)}

\begin{figure*}
 \vspace{5.5cm}
  \caption{An example figure spanning two-columns in which space has been left
  for the artwork.}\label{twocol-figure}
\end{figure*}

\verb"figure" environment which would override these decisions. See
`Instructions for Authors' in {\em Geophysical Journal International\/}
the \verb"\caption" command should appear after the figure or space
left for an illustration. For example, Fig.~\ref{sample-figure} is
produced using the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
 \vspace{5.5cm}
 \caption{An example figure in which space has
          been left for the artwork.}
 \label{sample-figure}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

should be used as in  Fig.~\ref{twocol-figure} using the following commands
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure*}
 \vspace{5.5cm}
   \caption{An example figure spanning two-columns
     in which space has been left for the artwork.}
   \label{twocol-figure}
\end{figure*}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Tables}

\verb"table" environment which would override these decisions. Table
captions should be at the top, therefore the \verb"\caption" command

The \verb"tabular" environment can be used to produce tables with
following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item additional vertical space is inserted on either side of a rule;
  \item vertical lines are not produced.
\end{enumerate}
Commands to redefine quantities such as \verb"\arraystretch" should be
omitted. For example, Table~\ref{symbols} is produced using the
following commands.
\begin{table}
 \caption{Seismic velocities at major discontinuities.}\label{symbols}
 \begin{tabular}{@{}lcccccc}
  Class & depth & radius
        & $\alpha _{-}$ & $\alpha _{+}$
        & $\beta _{-}$ & $\beta _{+}$ \\
  ICB & 5154 & 1217 & 11.091 & 10.258
        & 3.438 &  0. \\
  CMB & 2889 & 3482 & 8.009 & 13.691
        & 0. & 7.301 \\
 \end{tabular}

 \medskip
 The ICB represents the boundary between the inner and outer cores and
subscript $-$ are evaluated just below the discontinuity and
those with subscript $+$ are evaluated just above the discontinuity.
\end{table}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}
 \caption{Seismic velocities at major
          discontinuities.}
 \label{symbols}
 \begin{tabular}{@{}lcccccc}
  Class & depth & radius
        & $\alpha _{-}$ & $\alpha _{+}$
        & $\beta _{-}$ & $\beta _{+}$ \\
  ICB & 5154 & 1217 & 11.091 & 10.258
        & 3.438 &  0. \\
  CMB & 2889 & 3482 & 8.009 & 13.691
        & 0. & 7.301 \\
 \end{tabular}

 \medskip
 The ICB represents the boundary ...
... evaluated just above the discontinuity.

\end{table}
\end{verbatim}

If you have a table that is to extend over two columns, you need to use
\verb"table*" in a minipage environment, i.e., you can say
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table*}
\begin{minipage}{80mm}
 \caption{Caption which will wrap round to the
          width of the minipage environment.}
 \begin{tabular}{%
      :
 \end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\end{table*}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Running headlines}

three use et~al. The \verb"\pagestyle" and \verb"\thispagestyle"
commands should {\em not\/} be used. Similarly, the commands
\verb"\markright" and \verb"\markboth" should not be necessary.

\subsection{Typesetting mathematics}

\subsubsection{Displayed mathematics}

provided that you use the \LaTeX\ standard of open and closed square brackets
\[
 \sum_{i=1}^p \lambda_i =
{\mathrm{trace}}(\mathbf{S})
\]
was typeset in the GJI style using the commands
\begin{verbatim}
\[
 \sum_{i=1}^p \lambda_i =
{\mathrm{trace}}(\mathbf{S})
\]
\end{verbatim}
equation, \[ \alpha_{j+1} > \bar{\alpha}+ks_{\alpha} \]
which was (wrongly) typeset using double dollars as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
$$ \alpha_{j+1} > \bar{\alpha}+ks_{\alpha} $$
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb"\mathrm" will produce a roman character in math mode.

For numbered equations use the \verb"equation" and \verb"eqnarray" environments
which will give the correct positioning. If equation numbering by section is
required the command \verb"\eqsecnum" should appear after \verb"begin{document}"

\subsubsection{Bold math italic}\label{boldmathitalic}

The class file provides a font \verb"\mitbf" defined as:
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\mitbf}[1]{
  \hbox{\mathversion{bold}$#1$}}
\end{verbatim}
Which can be used as follows, to typset the equation
\begin{equation}
  d(\mitbf{s_{t_u}}) = \langle {[RM(\mitbf{x_y} + \mitbf{s_t}) - RM(\mitbf{x_y})]}^2 \rangle
\end{equation}
the input should be
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
  d(\mitbf{s_{t_u}}) = \langle {[RM(\mitbf{x_y}
  + \mitbf{s_t}) - RM(\mitbf{x_y})]}^2 \rangle
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

messages in your log file that read something like ``Warning: Font/shape
`cmm/b/it' in size~\hbox{$< \!\! 9 \!\! >$} not available on input line 649.
Warning: Using external font `cmmi9' instead on input line 649.'' If you have


\subsubsection{Bold Greek}\label{boldgreek}

To get bold Greek you use the same method as for bold math italic. Thus you can
input
\begin{verbatim}
\[ \mitbf{{\alpha_{\mu}}} =
\mitbf{\Theta} \alpha. \]
\end{verbatim}
to typeset the equation \[ \mitbf{{\alpha_{\mu}}} = \mitbf{\Theta} \alpha. \]


\subsection{Points to note in formatting text}\label{formtext}

\begin{quote}
\$ \& \% \# \_ \{ and \}
\end{quote}
must be typed
\begin{center}
\begin{quote}
\verb"\$" \verb"\&" \verb"\%" \verb"\#" \verb"\_" \verb"\{" and \verb"\}".
\end{quote}
\end{center}

\LaTeX\ interprets all double quotes as closing quotes. Therefore quotation
\texttt{``quoted text.''}

they are typed within math commands (\verb"$>$" or \verb"$<$").

The command \verb"\chemical" is provided to set chemical species with an even
level for subscripts (not produced in standard mathematics mode). Thus
\verb"\chemical{Fe_{2}^{2+}Cr_{2}O_{4}}" will produce
\chemical{Fe_{2}^{2+}Cr_{2}O_{4}}.


\subsection{Bibliography}

Two methods are provided for managing citations and references. The first
approach uses the \verb"\begin{thebibliography}{}" and
\verb"\end{thebibliography}{}" commands.

The second approach uses a simplified scheme using \verb"\begin{references}" and
\verb"\end{references}" commands.

e.g. Draine (1978) or (Begelman, Blandford \& Rees 1984). Where more than one
reference is cited having the same author$(s)$ and date, the letters a,b,c,
\ldots\ should follow the date; e.g.\ Smith (1988a), Smith (1988b), etc. The

\subsubsection{Biblography References in the text}

\textendash{} \verb"\cite{key}" \textendash{} to produce the author and date,
and another form \textendash{} \verb"\shortcite{key}" \textendash{} which
produces the date only. Thus, Rutherford \& Hawker \shortcite{rh} is produced by
\begin{verbatim}
Rutherford \& Hawker \shortcite{rh}
\end{verbatim}
while~\cite{hi} is produced by
\begin{verbatim}
\cite{hi}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{The bibliography}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item if an author has written several papers, some with other authors, the
        which, in turn, precede the multi-author papers;
  \item within the two-author paper citations, the order is determined by the
  \item within the multi-author paper citations, the order is chronological,
