\section{Introduction}

APWPs are generated by combining paleomagnetic poles for a particular rigid
block over the desired age range to produce a smoothed path.

\subsection{Not All Data Are Created Equal}

However, uncertainties in the age and location of paleomagnetic poles can vary
greatly for different poles.

\subsubsection{Age Error}

Although remanent magnetizations are generally assumed to be primary, many
events can cause remagnetisation (in which case the derived pole is `younger'
than the rock). If an event that has occurred since the rock's formation that
should affect the magnetisation (e.g., folding, thermal overprinting due to
intrusion) can be shown to have affected it, then it constrains the
magnetisation to have been acquired before that event. Recognising or ruling
out remagnetisations depends on these field tests, which are not always
performed or possible. Even a passed field test may not be useful if field test
shows magnetisation acquired prior to a folding event tens of millions of years
after initial rock formation.

The most obvious characteristic we can observe from paleomagnetic data is that
some poles have very large age ranges, e.g., more than 100 myr. The
magnetization age should be some time between the information of the rock and
folding events. There are also others where we have similar position but the
age constraint is much narrower, e.g. 10 myr window or less. Obviously the
latter kind of data is more valuable than the one with large age range.

\subsubsection{Position Error}

The errors of pole latitudes and longitudes are 95\% confidence ellipses,
which also vary greatly in magnitude. All paleomagnetic poles have some
associated uncertainties due to measurement error and the nature of the
geomagnetic field. More uncertainties can be added by too few samples,
sampling spanning too short a time range to approximate a GAD field, failure
to remove overprints during demagnetisation, etc.

\subsubsection{Data Consistency}

Paleomagnetic poles of a rigid plate or block should be continuous time series.
For a rigid plate, two poles with similar ages shouldn't be dramatically
different in location. Sometimes, this is the case. Sometimes we have further
separated poles with close ages.

There are a number of possible causes for these outliers, including:

\verb"Lithology"

For poor consistency of data, it is potentially because of different
inclinations or declinations. The first thing we should consider about is
their lithology. We want to check if the sample rock are igneous or
sedimentary, because sediment compaction can result in anomalously shallow
inclinations~\cite{T16}. In addition, we also can check if the rock are
redbeds or non-redbeds. Although whether redbeds record a detrital signal or a
later Chemical Remanent Magnetization (CRM) is still somewhat controversial,
both sedimentary rocks and redbeds could lead to inconsistency in direction
compared to igneous rocks.

\verb"Local Rotations"

Local deformation between two paleomagnetic localities invalidates the rigid
plate assumption and could lead to inconsistent VGP directions. So if
discordance is due to local deformation, and we would ideally want to exclude
such poles from our APWP calculation.

\verb"Other Factors"

In most cases, mean pole age (centre of age error) has just been binned. If
any of the poles have large age errors, they could be different ages from each
other and sample entirely different parts of the APWP\@. Conversely, if any of
the poles have too few samples, or were not sampled over enough time to average
to a GAD field, a discordant pole may be due to unreduced secular variation.

\subsubsection{Data Density}

As we go back in time, we have lower quality and lower density (or quantity) of
data, for example, the Precambrian or Early Paleozoic paleomagnetic data are
relatively fewer than Middle-Late Phanerozoic ones, and most of them are not
high-quality, e.g., larger errors in both age and location. The combination of
lower data quality with lower data density means that a single `bad' pole (with
large errors in age and/or location) can much more easily distort the
reconstructed APWP, because there are few or no `good' poles to counteract its
influence.

Data density also varies between different plates. E.g., we have a relatively
high density of paleomagnetic data for North American Craton (NAC), but few
poles exist for Greenland and Arabia. Based on mean age (mean of lower and
upper magnetic ages), for 100\textendash0 Ma, GPMDB 4.6b~\cite{P05} has 198 NAC
poles, but only 17 for Greenland and 24 for Arabia.

\subsubsection{Publication Year}

The time when the data was published should also be considered, because
magnetism measuring methodology, technology and equipments have been improved
since the early 20th century. For example, stepwise demagnetisation, which is
the most reliable method of detecting and removing secondary overprints, has
only been in common use since the mid 1980s.

In summary, not all paleomagnetic poles are created equal, which leads to an
important question: how to best combine poles of varying quality into a
coherent and accurate APWP\@?

\subsection{Existing Solutions and General Issues}

Paleomagnetists have proposed a variety of methods
to filter so-called ``bad'' data, or give lower weights to those ``bad'' data
before generating an APWP, e.g., two widely used methods: the V90 reliability
criteria~\cite{v90} and the BC02 selection criteria provided by Besse \&
Courtillot \shortcite{B02}. Briefly, the V90 criteria for paleomagnetic results
includes seven criteria: (1) Well determined age; (2) At least 25 samples with
Fisher~\cite{F53} precision $\kappa$ greater than 10 and $\alpha95$ less than
16\degree; (3) Detailed demagnetisation results reported; (4) Passed field
tests; (5) Tectonic coherence with continent and good structural control; (6)
Identified antipodal reversals; (7) Lack of similarity with younger
poles~\cite{T92}. The total criteria satisfied (0\textendash7) is then used as
a measure of a paleomagnetic result's overall reliability, which is known as Q
(quality) factor~\cite{T92}. Q factor is indeed a very straightforward way to
get a quantitalized reliability score. Also it then can be conveniently used in
the later calculations of APWPs~\cite{T92}. But at the same time this is a
fairly basic filter that lumps together criteria that may not be equally
important. Compared with V90, the BC02 criteria suggests stricter filtering,
e.g., using only poles with at least 6 sampling sites and 36 samples, each site
having $\alpha95$ less than 10\degree\ in the Cenozoic and 15\degree\ in the
Mesozoic. B02 is also straightforward and convenient to use, but some useful
data may be filtered out and wasted especially for a period where there are
only limited number of data. In addition, there has been limited study of how
effective these marking/filtering methods are at reconstructing a `true' APWP,
and for most studies after a basic filtering of `low quality' poles, the
remaining poles are, in fact, treated equally.

Above all, there haven't been any real attempts to study how APWP fits may be
improved by filtering/weighting data. This paper is presented to address these
issues.



\section{Methods}

For most of Earth history, concretely for times before c. 170 Ma, the age of the
oldest magnetic anomaly identification, paleomagnetism is the only accepted
quantitative method for reconstructing plate motions and past paleogeographies.
After about 170 Ma, multiple data sources can help constrain plate motions in
more accurate ways. One of the most developed and studied plate kinematics
models is the Fixed Hotspot Model~\cite{M93,M99}, which assumes the Atlantic and
Indian hotspots are relatively fixed. Such a model like the Fixed Hotspot can
predict APWPs for main continents, e.g.\ the North America.

\subsection{Reference Path: The Hotspot Model Predicted}

The oldest pole that can be predicted from the Fixed Hotspot Model is about 120
Ma.

\subsection{120\textendash0 Ma North America APWP}

The \textbf{Global Paleomagnetic Database} (GPMDB) Version 4.6b~\cite{P05},
data source used here, includes 9360 paleopoles for ages of 3,500 Ma to the
present published from 1925 to January 2011. A polygon can be drawn around a set
of data, whose sampling sites we believe belong to a specific plate or rigid
block. Then the {\em Spatial Join\/} technique~\cite{J07} helps join attributes
from the polygon to the paleomagnetic data based on the spatial relationship
allowing data within this polygon to be extracted from the whole raw large
dataset without splitting a subset just for a specific plate. That allows us to
quickly select subsets of the database based on geographic constraints just as
easily as for age. Of course, the boundary of this polygon must be reasonably
along a tectonic boundary.

Plate ID 101 polygon in the recently published Plate Model~\cite{M16},
including its children 108 and 109 polygons for 120\textendash0 Ma, is used to select the
sampling sites of the paleopoles for North America. According to the plate model
rotation data~\cite{M16}, the Avalon/Acadia block (108) is fixed to 101 during the
geologic period from Cretaceous to the present day. The Piedmont block (109) is
also fixed to 101 since about 300 Ma~\cite{C14}. Then in order to be compared
with the Fix Hotspot Model (120\textendash0 Ma)~\cite{M93,M99}, the paleopoles with age
ranging 120\textendash0 Ma are further selected through constraining the lower magnetic
age ``LOMAGAGE <=120''. According to a published plate kinematic model of
southwestern North America since 36 Ma~\cite{Mc06}, the paleopoles constrained
by some western terranes whose Plate IDs are also 101 and those that are fixed to
101 during 120\textendash0 Ma shown in the plate model rotation data~\cite{M16} except
some constrained by a small terrane 101 are removed. So finally there are four
polygons total for this Plate Model~\cite{M16}. According to the plate
kinematic model of southwestern North America~\cite{Mc06}, the poles with age
younger than 10 Ma located within the western 101 terrane (RANGE_ID=74 in the
plate kinematic model~\cite{Mc06}) right south of the smallest 101 one should
be included.
