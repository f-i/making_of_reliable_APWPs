\subsection{How to Constrain Plate 101's Data}
The data-constraining polygons are from the recently published plate
model~\cite{Y18} (Fig.~\ref{fig_NApolygon}).
Plate ID 101 polygon in the recently published Plate Model~\cite{Y18}, including
its children 108 (Avalon/Acadia block) and 109 (Piedmont block) polygons for
120\textendash0 Ma, is used to select the sampling sites of the paleopoles for
North America. According to the plate model rotation data~\cite{Y18}, 108 is
fixed to 101 during the geologic period from Cretaceous to the present day. 109
is also fixed to 101 since about 300 Ma~\cite{C14}. Then in order to be compared
with the FHM (120\textendash0 Ma)~\cite{M93,M99}, the paleopoles with age
ranging 120\textendash0 Ma are further selected through constraining the lower
magnetic age ``LOMAGAGE $<=$ 120''. Based on a published plate kinematic model
of southwestern North America since 36 Ma~\cite{Mc06}, part of the paleopoles
constrained by the four small western terranes whose Plate IDs are also 101 in
fact had gone through regional rotations and here are removed. Finally, the
poles with age younger than 10 Ma located within the largest western 101 terrane
(on the south of the smallest western 101 terrane; corresponding to the
RANGE\_ID=74 polygon in the model~\cite{Mc06}) should be included. In addition,
the RESULTNO=6007 dataset should also be included according to this
model~\cite{Mc06}, although it is in the PlateID=178 polygon.

America.}\label{fig_NApolygon}

The 101, 108 and 109 polygons constrained 191 datasets (Fig.~\ref{fig_NApmdata}).

and 109 polygons for North America.}\label{fig_NApmdata}
\end{figure}

A published rotation dataset~\cite{Mc06} (Fig.~\ref{fig_NAwUS}) is used to
remove part of those poles from west US areas. So finally 133 of the 191
datasets remain (Fig.~\ref{fig_NAfinal}).
