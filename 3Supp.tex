\subsection{How to Constrain Plate 101's Data}
The data-constraining polygons are from the recently published plate
model~\cite{Y18} (Fig.~\ref{fig_NApolygon}). Plate ID 101 polygon in the
recently published Plate Model~\cite{Y18}, including its children 108
(Avalon/Acadia block) and 109 (Piedmont block) polygons for 120\textendash0 Ma,
is used to select the sampling sites of the paleopoles for North America.
According to the plate model rotation data~\cite{Y18}, 108 is fixed to 101
during the geologic period from Cretaceous to the present day. 109 is also fixed
to 101 since about 300 Ma~\cite{C14}. Then in order to be compared with the FHM
(120\textendash0 Ma)~\cite{M93,M99}, the paleopoles with age ranging
120\textendash0 Ma are further selected through constraining the lower magnetic
age ``LOMAGAGE $<=$ 120''. In addition, the RESULTNO=6007 dataset should also be
included according to a published plate kinematic model~\cite{Mc06}
(Fig.~\ref{fig_NAwUS}), although it is in the PlateID=178 polygon. In the end,
191 datasets in total are extracted (Fig.~\ref{fig_NApmdata}).

(yellow with labels) used to constrain the 120\textendash0 Ma data for North
America.}\label{fig_NApolygon}
\end{figure}

Also based on this model of southwestern North America since 36 Ma~\cite{Mc06}
(Fig.~\ref{fig_NAwUS}), part of the paleopoles constrained by the four small
western terranes whose Plate IDs are also 101 in fact had gone through regional
rotations and here are removed. However, the poles with age younger than 10 Ma
located within the largest western 101 terrane (on the south of the smallest
western 101 terrane; corresponding to the RANGE\_ID=74 polygon in the
model~\cite{Mc06}) should be included. So finally 133 of the 191 datasets remain
(Fig.~\ref{fig_NAfinal}). Spatially North American paleomagnetic data are mainly
from the western and eastern margins of the plate.

\subsection{How to Constrain Plate 801's Data}
Plate ID 801 polygon in the recently published Plate Model~\cite{Y18}, including
its children 675 (Sumba block) and 684 (Timor block) polygons for
120\textendash0 Ma (Fig.~\ref{fig_AUpolygon}), is used to select the sampling
sites of the paleopoles for Australia (Fig.~\ref{fig_AUpmdata}). According to
the plate model rotation data~\cite{Y18}, 675 and 684 are fixed to 101 during
the geologic period from c.145 Ma to the present.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=.32]{figures/801children.pdf}
\caption{The Plate ID 801 polygons (yellow) with its children 675 and 684
(yellow with labels) used to constrain the 120\textendash0 Ma data for
Australia.}\label{fig_AUpolygon}
\end{figure}

On the southeast of the main Australia plate (the largest polygon in
Fig.~\ref{fig_AUpolygon}), there is a triangle-shaped polygon 850 (Tasmania
block) which is fixed to 801 since c.100 Ma according to the~\cite{Y18}
rotation data. With that attribute, 805 contributes more data younger than
c.100Ma for the later analysis. Ultimately the final 97 extracted datasets is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_AUfinal}.

\subsection{How to Constrain Plate 501's Data}
Plate ID 501 polygons in the recently published Plate Model~\cite{Y18} includes
the two small polygons of the northern Lesser Himalayan pass margin Greater
Indian Basin and Tethyan Himalayan microcontinent of Greater India
(Fig.~\ref{fig_INpolygon}), is used to select the sampling
sites of the paleopoles for India (Fig.~\ref{fig_INpmdata}).

\begin{figure}

\caption{All the 120\textendash0 Ma data constrained by the Plate ID 501
polygons for India.}\label{fig_INpmdata}
\end{figure}

Also based on this model of the tectonic interactions between India, Arabia and
Asia since the Jurassic~\cite{G15} (Fig.~\ref{fig_INrfd}), part of the
paleopoles constrained by the north two small terranes whose Plate IDs are also
501 in fact had gone through regional rotations and here are removed. So finally
74 datasets are left (Fig.~\ref{fig_INfinal}). Spatially Indian paleomagnetic
data are more evenly distributed on the India plate than North American and
Australian above.
