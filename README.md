# Making of Reliable APWPs

About how many ways we have to make paleomagnetic APWPs, and most importantly
which one(s) is(are) the best (determined by using the algorithm in another
repository: https://github.com/f-i/APWP_similarity)

## Supplementary Materials

The ``data'' folder contains the results from comparisons of Plate 101 paths and
FHS model predicted path. Here is the visualizations of 168 different
comparisons (Click on the image below to view the video):
