# Making of Reliable APWPs

About how many ways we have to make paleomagnetic APWPs, and most importantly
which one(s) is(are) the best (determined by using the algorithm in another
repository: https://github.com/f-i/APWP_similarity)

## Supplementary Materials

The "data" folder contains two subfolders. The "FHM" includes all the results
from comparisons of Plates 101, 501 and 801's paleomagnetic paths and their
Fixed Hotspot model predicted paths. The "MHM" includes all the results from
comparisons of Plates 101, 501 and 801's paleomagnetic paths and their Moving
Hotspot model predicted paths. Here is the video visualising the 168 different
comparisons for Plate 101's paleomagnetic paths and its Fixed Hotspot model
predicted & plate circuit projected path (Click on the image below to view the
video):

And here are the corresponding distributions of paleomagnetic data picked from
28 different picking methods and then weighted by 6 different weighting methods:
