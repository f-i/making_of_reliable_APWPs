# Making of Reliable APWPs

About how many ways we have to make paleomagnetic APWPs, and most importantly
which one(s) is(are) the best (determined by using the algorithm in another

## Supplementary Materials

The "data" folder contains two subfolders. The "FHM" includes all the results
from comparisons of Plates 101 (North America), 501 (India) and 801
(Australia)'s paleomagnetic paths and their Fixed Hotspot model (FHM) predicted
paths. The "MHM" includes all the results from comparisons of Plates 101, 501
and 801's paleomagnetic paths and their Moving Hotspot model (MHM) predicted
paths.

Here is the video visualising the comparisons for Plate 101's 168 different
paleomagnetic paths and its Fixed Hotspot model predicted & plate circuit
projected path (Click on the image below to view the video):

And here are the corresponding distributions of paleomagnetic data picked from
28 different picking methods and then weighted by 6 different weighting methods:
